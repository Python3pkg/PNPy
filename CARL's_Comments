- CAP only gets recorded if h5py is installed. Do in terminal:
	sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev
	pip install h5py

... if you don't have pip:
    go to https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
    download pip
    type in terminal:
        python get-pip.py
- nrnivmodl needs to be run with all modules at once, not one after the other.
    nrnivmodl AXNODE.mod xtra.mod vecevent.mod
- the paths are often set differently. Would be good to have path-set-functions for everything! No 'magic strings'
- run the bundle_paper-scripts. Those work. E.g.:
    run bundle_paper.py
        once with save_CAP=True and the save-lines for the CAP-file not commented out
        once with save_CAP=False and the save-lines for the voltage-file not commented out
    run figure1.py
