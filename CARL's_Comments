- CAP and voltage-recording are not done at the same time, but alternatively. The 'rec_CAP' and the 'rec_V'-Flag therefore need to be set to True one after the other. If both are set to True, only CAP gets recorded.
	Reason?
- CAP only gets recorded if h5py is installed. Do in terminal:
	sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev
	pip install h5py

... if you don't have pip:
    go to https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
    download pip
    type in terminal:
        python get-pip.py
- nrnivmdl needs to be run with all modules at once, not one after the other.
- the paths are often set differently. Would be good to have path-set-functions for everything! No 'magic strings'
